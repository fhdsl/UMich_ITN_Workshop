## Additional Resources

- Material for this workshop is adapted from the [Choosing Genomics Tools ITN course](https://bit.ly/genomics-tools) which is a sort of wikipedia for -omics analyses. That and our other courses are available for free. See [our website](https://www.itcrtraining.org/courses) for more information.
- The ITCR provides [tables broken by down data type with information on available analysis tools](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/cssi/resources/informatics-tools)
