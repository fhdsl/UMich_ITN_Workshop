Lee et al. (2024) Spatial dissection of tumour microenvironments in gastric cancers 
reveals the immunosuppressive crosstalk between CCL2+ fibroblasts and STAT3- 
activatedÂ macrophages (https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2024-332901).

DESCRIPTION:
These samples result from tumor biopsies collected from a patient cohort with gastric cancer (GC). 
The researchers profiled the samples with 10X Visium to study the gene expression in malignant,
stromal, and immune cells within the GC tumor microenvironment. 

The data set presented here is a subset of the original cohort. Two samples have been 
selected for this example:

- sample_00732 (Intestinal GC)
- sample_01675 (Diffuse GC)
